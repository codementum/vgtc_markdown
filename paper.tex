%% Uncomment one of the lines above depending on where your paper is
%% in the conference process. ``review'' and ``widereview'' are for review
%% submission, ``preprint'' is for pre-publication, and the final version
%% doesn't use a specific qualifier. Further, ``electronic'' includes
%% hyperreferences for more convenient online viewing.

%% Please use one of the ``review'' options in combination with the
%% assigned online id (see below) ONLY if your paper uses a double blind
%% review process. Some conferences, like IEEE Vis and InfoVis, have NOT
%% in the past.

%% Figures should be in CMYK or Grey scale format, otherwise, colour 
%% shifting may occur during the printing process.

%% These three lines bring in essential packages: ``mathptmx'' for Type 1 
%% typefaces, ``graphicx'' for inclusion of EPS figures. and ``times''
%% for proper handling of the times font family.

\usepackage{mathptmx}
\usepackage{graphicx}
\usepackage{times}

%% We encourage the use of mathptmx for consistent usage of times font
%% throughout the proceedings. However, if you encounter conflicts
%% with other math-related packages, you may want to disable it.

%% If you are submitting a paper to a conference for review with a double
%% blind reviewing process, please replace the value ``0'' below with your
%% OnlineID. Otherwise, you may safely leave it at ``0''.
